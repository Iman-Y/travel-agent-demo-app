## Exercise 3: Support Menu Implementation with Coding Agent in Github 
```
#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Issue
1. Navigate to your repository's Issues tab
2. Create a new issue with the title: "Implement Support Menu Item with FAQ, Contact Form, and Contact Info"
3. In the issue description, provide detailed requirements:
   ```markdown
   ## Requirements
   - Add "Support" link to main navigation (Header component)
   - Create support landing page with overview of support options
   - Implement FAQ page with collapsible questions and search functionality
   - Create contact/enquiry form with validation and submission handling
   - Add contact information page with company details and office hours
   
   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] Support menu item appears in both desktop and mobile navigation
   - [ ] All support pages follow existing design patterns and responsiveness
   - [ ] FAQ component includes search and category filtering
   - [ ] Contact form includes proper validation and error handling
   - [ ] Contact information is well-structured and accessible
   - [ ] All components include TypeScript types and proper testing

4. Assign the issue to "Copilot" Coding Agent for implementation


#### Step 2: Monitor Agent Progress
1. Observe how the agent analyzes the current codebase
2. Note the agent's planning approach and file organization decisions
3. Watch how the agent handles component dependencies and imports
4. Review the agent's approach to styling and consistency

#### Step 3: Review and Test
1. Once the agent completes the implementation, thoroughly test all functionality
2. Check responsiveness across different screen sizes
3. Validate form functionality and error handling
4. Test navigation integration
5. Verify TypeScript compilation and lint compliance

- [ ] Functional contact form with validation and proper error states
- [ ] Contact information page with company details
- [ ] All components follow existing project patterns and conventions
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design maintained throughout
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined for all new interfaces
- [ ] Code passes existing lint and build processes
