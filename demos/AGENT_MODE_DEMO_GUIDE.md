## Exercise 1: Advanced Search Filtering with Plan Mode and then Agent Mode
```

I want to add a country-based filter to our trip search functionality. Please analyze the current SearchForm component and help me implement a country dropdown filter. This should:
 
   1. Add a country field to the SearchFilters interface
   2. Update the SearchForm component to include a country dropdown
   3. Modify the search logic to filter by country
   4. Update the mock data to include country information for existing trips
   
  
   ```

## Exercise 2: Use the Copilot CLI to implement the below
```

I want to add some Christmas cheer to the website with a festive color theme. This should include the following:

Create a Christmas color palette:
In tailwind.config.js,
please add a new color palette with festive colors. I'm thinking of traditional Christmas colors like deep reds, forest greens, and gold for accents.
* For example:
* primary: A festive red.
* secondary: A rich green.
* accent: A warm gold.

Apply the new theme:

Update the Header and Footer to use the new primary and secondary colors.
Change the Button component styles in Button.tsx to use the new Christmas colors for the different variants (default, secondary, etc.).
Update the background colors and text colors throughout the site to match the new theme.
Add a festive touch:

Please add a simple, festive icon (like a snowflake or a Santa hat) next to the logo in the Header component.
On the homepage (page.tsx), let's add a banner that says "Happy Holidays! Find your perfect winter getaway."
Review and Finalize:

Ensure the color changes are consistent across all pages (/trips, /bookings, etc.).
Make sure the text is still readable with the new background colors.
